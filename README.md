Introduction :
Student Management System is an application that provides all facilities for themaintenance of records of the students. Insert, View, Search, Delete, Update, andSort  records of students with showing statistics. The system will be good for learning basic concepts of C++ programming, suchasmanipulating arrays, handling files, and performing input/output operations throughaconsole. It provides an extensive menu-driven interface to interact with variousfunctionalities efficiently

Language & Interface :
This Student Management System uses C++ as the programming language and a commandline interface. The application provides facility to store and manage records of the studentsusing arrays â€“ student ID, name, age, course

Required Modules or Packages :-
To execute the Student Management System, the system should have any C++ compiler installed. The most common C++ compilers are GCC and Clang. No external library or module is required for application functionality. How to Execute the Code To compile and execute the Student Management System on your local machine, followthese steps:
1. Save the Code: In a file with the name student_management_system.cpp, copy the following C++ code.

2. Compile the Code: The following code should be compiled using a C++ compiler. To compile it using g++, for instance:

$ g++ -o student_management_system student_management_system.cpp

3. Execution of the Program: Once the compilation is done, run the resultant program by using

$ ./student_management_system

Code Explanation:
Overview
The Student Management System designed here has been developed for variousfunctionalities w.r.t maintaining student records. The description of major parts of this codeis provided below.

void printCentered(const string &text, int width) {
    int padding = (width - text.length()) / 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < padding; ++i) {
        cout << " ";
    }
    cout << text << endl;
}
This function prints text centered within a specified width

void insertStudent() {
    if (studentCount >= MAX_STUDENTS) {
        printCentered("Student record list is full.", 100);
        return;
    }
    // Input and validation code here
}
// This function will enable the user to insert a new student record in the system. Theprovided ID needs to be unique, and the input values need to be valid.

void viewAllStudents() {
    if (studentCount == 0) {
        printCentered("No student records found.", 100);
        return;
    }
    // Code to display all student records here
}
This function lists all the student records currently in the system.

void searchStudentByID() {
    int id;
    // Code to search for a student by ID here
}
This method will allow the user to find a student record based on the inputted name.

Delete Student Record

void deleteStudent() {
    int id;
    // Code to delete a student record goes here
}
This function allows the users to update a student record by ID.

Sort Students by Name

void sortStudentsByName() {
    // Code to sort students by name here
}
This function sorts the list of student records by their names in alphabetical order.

Display Statistics

void displayStatistics() {
    if (studentCount == 0) {
        printCentered("No student records to calculate statistics.", 100);
        return;
    }
    // Code here to display statistics
}
It also shows statistical information, like the number of students and average age
